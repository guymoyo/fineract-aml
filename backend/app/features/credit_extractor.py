"""Customer-level credit feature extraction.

Unlike the transaction-level FeatureExtractor (which computes 22 features
per individual transaction), this module aggregates a customer's entire
transaction history into credit-relevant features over 30d/90d/180d windows.

These features feed into the CreditScorer for behavioral credit scoring.

Feature categories:
- Deposit patterns: consistency, volume, trend
- Withdrawal patterns: volume, trend
- Net flow & savings: income vs spending ratio
- Account activity: frequency, age, counterparty diversity
- Loan behavior: repayment rate (when loan transactions exist)
- Risk history: fraud alerts, geographic stability
- Transfer behavior: incoming/outgoing ratios, sender diversity
