"""Shadow model promotion task.

Promotes the shadow (challenger) model to production after validation.

The shadow model is automatically updated after each successful training run
(see tasks/training.py). It can be promoted manually via this task once analysts
have verified that shadow scores are consistently better than production.

Typical workflow:
  1. Fraud classifier retrains → shadow slot is updated automatically
  2. Analysts compare shadow_score vs production score in the dashboard (7d)
  3. If shadow AUC > production AUC + 0.02 consistently, run this task
  4. Production model is replaced; shadow slot becomes the former production model
